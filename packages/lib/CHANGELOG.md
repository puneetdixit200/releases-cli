### Patch Changes

- caf3cdc: **Fix `releases admin embed {releases,entities,changelogs}` after monorepo route consolidation**

  The API worker moved the three embed-backfill triggers from `/v1/admin/embed/*` to `/v1/workflows/embed-*` in [buildinternet/releases#494](https://github.com/buildinternet/releases/issues/494). Without this bump, those three commands return `404` against the live API.

  Changes:
  - `embedReleases` now posts to `/v1/workflows/embed-releases`
  - `embedEntities` now posts to `/v1/workflows/embed-entities`
  - `embedChangelogs` now posts to `/v1/workflows/embed-changelogs`
  - `getEmbedStatus` stays on `/v1/admin/embed/status` (telemetry reads were not moved)

  The `releases admin embed …` command surface is unchanged — the path rename is invisible to users.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- e04effe: **Skills synced to the monorepo's consolidated tool surface**

  Mirrors the tool-UX consolidation from the monorepo (upstream issue [buildinternet/releases#459](https://github.com/buildinternet/releases/issues/459)). Deprecated per-action tool names are replaced with the consolidated equivalents across every skill that cited them.

  Typed-tool renames:
  - `add_source` / `edit_source` / `remove_source` / `fetch_source` → `manage_source` with `action: "add" | "edit" | "remove" | "fetch"`
  - `get_playbook` / `update_playbook_notes` → `manage_playbook` with `action: "get" | "update_notes"`
  - `list_categories` — retired; valid categories surface via `manage_org` / `manage_product` tool descriptions and system prompts

  Skill-specific changes:
  - `managing-sources` — Primary Sources section rewritten with conditional `is_primary` guidance, added a note about the slug auto-suffix behavior on `manage_source(action=add)`, ported the Organization Descriptions + Embedding Side Effects sections from upstream.
  - `seeding-playbooks` and `parsing-changelogs` — replaced the stale `releases admin content playbook` CLI path with `releases admin playbook` (the `content` subgroup was removed in #42).
  - `analyzing-releases` and `finding-changelogs` — call-site updates only.

  No CLI behavior changes.

## 0.18.0

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- eaeb755: **`releases admin discovery evaluate <url>` is back**

  Ships the missing thin wrapper around `GET /v1/evaluate?url=...`, returning the AI-backed ingestion recommendation (method, feed URL, provider, confidence, alternatives). Supports `--json` for piping into `jq`. Mirrors the typed MCP `evaluate_url` tool.

  The legacy top-level alias `releases evaluate <url>` still resolves to this subcommand (with a deprecation warning).

  The stale `discover` entry in the legacy alias table has been removed — it pointed to a subcommand that never existed, and the API's `POST /v1/discover` is already covered by `releases admin discovery onboard`. The one in-repo docs reference has been updated.

- 51ec406: **`releases admin playbook <org>` is back**

  Ships the missing CLI wrapper for reading and updating an organization's playbook. Same shape as the old monorepo command, flattened from `admin content playbook` to `admin playbook` (no other live inhabitants of the `admin content` subgroup remain).
  - `releases admin playbook <org>` — read the assembled playbook (header + agent notes)
  - `releases admin playbook <org> --json` — JSON output
  - `releases admin playbook <org> --notes "..."` — replace agent notes; seeds a fresh header on first write

  The old `--regenerate` flag is not being ported. It called deterministic logic (no AI) that already runs automatically via `waitUntil` after every source add/edit/remove, and the `--notes` PATCH route auto-seeds a fresh header if no playbook exists yet.

  Closes buildinternet/releases#246.

## 0.16.1

### Patch Changes

- 8c3a579: Fix `--json` output being truncated at ~96 KB when piped to another process. All JSON output now awaits stdout `drain` before the CLI exits, so piping `releases admin source list --json | jq ...` works correctly on large datasets.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 7e617c7: **CLI JSON contract: shared envelope, parsed metadata, truncation warnings**

  `releases list --json` now returns a consistent `{ items, pagination }` envelope whether or not `--limit` is passed, parses `metadata` into a nested object (no more `.metadata | fromjson?` in jq), and emits a stderr warning when results may be truncated.
  - **New shared types** in `@buildinternet/releases-core/cli-contracts`: `ListResponse<T>`, `Pagination`, `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`, `computePagination()`, `parseMetadataField()`, `formatTruncationWarning()`. Single source of truth for the CLI's `--json` output shape.
  - **Default page size is now 500** (previously 100, the API's silent default) so a default `releases list --json` call returns 5× more rows before any risk of truncation. Explicit `--limit` still wins.
  - **Metadata fields are parsed** into nested objects in `--json` output for both the list view and single-source detail view.
  - **Stderr truncation warning** when no `--limit` was passed and `hasMore` is true — no more silent loss of rows.
  - **`--flat` flag** returns the legacy bare-array shape for scripts still tied to it. Not recommended; use the envelope.
  - **Server-side pagination** — `--limit` and `--page` are now passed through to the API instead of applied client-side to an already-truncated result set.

  Fixes buildinternet/releases-cli#24 (CLI side). An API-side follow-up will add an opt-in envelope response so `totalItems` can be populated for every page; until then `totalItems` is only set when the tail of the list is reached.

## 0.15.0

## 0.14.0

## 0.13.2

### Patch Changes

- 3d4df61: Pin CI to bun canary to pick up oven-sh/bun#29272 — fixes `bun build --compile` producing Mach-O binaries that Apple Silicon SIGKILLs on exec due to a broken LC_CODE_SIGNATURE size in bun 1.3.12. Also leapfrogs the npm version timeline past the orphaned `@buildinternet/releases@0.13.0` left behind during the monorepo → OSS repo extraction.

## 0.12.1

### Patch Changes

- ef08acb: Bootstrap public tap distribution — first release cut from the extracted OSS repo. Publishes binaries to `buildinternet/releases-cli` GitHub Releases and regenerates the Homebrew formula at `buildinternet/homebrew-tap`.
