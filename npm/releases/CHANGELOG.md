# @buildinternet/releases

## 0.39.1

### Patch Changes

- 69a38dc: Strip null/undefined fields from the `POST /v1/sources` request body in `createSource()`. The API's Zod schema treats `z.string().optional()` as "string or absent" — an explicit `"productId": null` in the JSON body trips the validator and 400s. Sending `--org <slug>` without `--product` previously triggered this. The fix filters null/undefined values before serialization so optional fields drop out cleanly.

## 0.39.0

### Minor Changes

- 7a2307c: Add `--metadata-set <key=value>` and `--metadata-unset <key>` flags to `releases admin source update`. Both are repeatable and thread through the existing `updateSourceMeta` client-side merge, so one-off source metadata patches (e.g. `--metadata-set crawlEnabled=true --metadata-set githubUrl=https://github.com/docker/compose`) no longer require custom scripts. Value coercion follows standard CLI conventions: `true`/`false`/`null` become JSON literals, finite number strings become numbers, values starting with `{` or `[` are parsed as JSON, and everything else is kept as a string.
- 1af16a3: Add `--kind <value>` support for the new source/product taxonomy (`platform | sdk | mobile | desktop | docs | integration | tool`). Write paths (`releases admin source update`, `releases admin product update`, `releases admin product create`) accept the flag and validate locally via `isValidKind` before hitting the API. Read paths (`releases list`, `releases admin source list`, `releases admin product list`, `releases search`) accept `--kind` as a filter and pass it through as a query string. The API applies inheritance (`COALESCE(source.kind, product.kind)`) on content-oriented surfaces and direct equality on metadata-oriented surfaces; see the help text for the per-command behavior. Bumps the pinned `@buildinternet/releases-core` and `@buildinternet/releases-api-types` to `^0.22.0`.

## 0.38.1

### Patch Changes

- d92295c: Set +x on the cross-compiled platform binaries before they're gzipped for distribution. Bun's `--compile` produces 0644 outputs for cross-targets on Linux runners, so the Homebrew formula's `bin.install` (which preserves source mode) landed a non-executable binary. v0.38.0 added a completion-generation step that exec'd the binary during install and failed with EACCES; the formula template now also chmods the binary defensively before install.

## 0.38.0

### Minor Changes

- df7dcae: feat(cli): add `--paused` / `--no-paused` flags to `admin org update` for the org-level ingest pause flag landed in [buildinternet/releases#1064](https://github.com/buildinternet/releases/pull/1064). Mirrors the existing `--enable` / `--disable` shape on `admin source update`; lands on the deprecated `edit` alias too. Pins `@buildinternet/releases-api-types` to `^0.20.0` so the typed `fetchPaused` field on `UpdateOrgBody` is in scope downstream. (#178)
- 21d41b2: MCP `list_organizations` now mirrors the remote MCP default of hiding orgs
  with zero indexed releases. Pass `include_empty: true` to see them.
  CLI `releases org list` gains `--include-empty` for the same opt-in.
  See buildinternet/releases#746.
- a4729e3: feat(cli): add shell completion support for bash, zsh, and fish. `releases completion <bash|zsh|fish>` prints the script to stdout; `releases completion install` detects the user's shell and writes the script to the conventional location, mirroring how `gh` ships completions. Once the matching tap formula update in buildinternet/buildinternet-homebrew-tap lands, Homebrew will install all three shells automatically — until then, `brew` users should run `releases completion install`. On interactive TTYs, a one-time stderr hint nudges users who haven't installed completions yet — silence with `RELEASES_NO_COMPLETION_HINT=1`.
- 5b1c5ae: feat(cli): add `releases skills install` for cross-agent skill installation (#187). Thin wrapper around `npx skills add buildinternet/releases-cli` from the open agent-skills ecosystem (`vercel-labs/skills`), which auto-detects ~50 supported coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, …) and writes the 8 bundled skill files to the right per-agent directory. Forwards `--global`, `--agent <name>`, `--copy`, `--list`, and `--no-yes` to the underlying `skills add` invocation. Skills are symlinked by default, so re-running the command refreshes everything atomically.
- 05f08be: feat(cli): nag when installed agent skills are behind the repo's `main` HEAD (#188). After a successful `releases skills install`, the CLI records the current `skills/` tree SHA as a baseline. Subsequent invocations poll GitHub (24h cache, 2s timeout, best-effort) and print a single dim stderr line — "Your installed releases skills are behind. Run `releases skills install` to refresh." — when the baseline diverges. Also reads the `skills` CLI's lock file (`$XDG_STATE_HOME/skills/.skill-lock.json` or `~/.agents/.skill-lock.json`) to suppress the nag when the user has clearly uninstalled via `skills` (lock present, zero `buildinternet/releases-cli` entries); manual installers and users without a lock file fall through to the existing baseline check, unchanged. Mirrors the existing CLI update-check pattern, with the same skip conditions (`--help`/`--version`, non-TTY, no baseline recorded) plus a fresh `RELEASES_DISABLE_SKILL_UPDATE_CHECK=1` opt-out.
- 839ab72: Remove deprecated `--notes` and `--parse-instructions` inline flags (Phase 2 of #103).

  Both flags were deprecated in Phase 1 (#118) with file-based replacements. They are now removed; passing either flag exits non-zero with `unknown option`. Use `--notes-file` and `--parse-instructions-file` (or `-` for stdin) instead.

### Patch Changes

- 5aad6aa: chore(cli): bump `@buildinternet/releases-api-types` to `^0.21.0` and align `sourceToMarkdown` with the cursor-paginated `SourceDetail` shape. The helper had no callers in production code; this is a types-alignment fix with zero runtime impact.
- 3b4b2a9: fix(cli): allow 0 for --min-new-releases and --min-overview-age-days in `admin overview batch` to match API contract (#174)
- ac18409: fix(cli): reject partial integers in parsePositiveIntFlag — "1.5" and "10abc" no longer silently truncate to 1 and 10 (#177)

## 0.37.0

### Minor Changes

- fe9ce0b: `releases admin overview batch` wraps the new `BatchOverviewWorkflow` (`POST /v1/workflows/batch-overview`). Flags map 1:1 to the workflow body: `--orgs <slug,slug>`, `--min-new-releases`, `--min-overview-age-days`, `--max-candidates`, `--max-cost-usd`. Pass `--wait` to poll the status endpoint every 30s until the workflow reaches a terminal state; without it the command prints `instanceId` + `statusUrl` and returns immediately.

  Sits next to the agent-driven `admin overview inputs` / `admin overview update` so the batch path is discoverable alongside the single-org regen flow. Closes #1005.

### Patch Changes

- ba51bdb: `releases org update --avatar <url>` now works end-to-end. The flag was already wired (it set `avatarUrl` in the PATCH body) but the API silently dropped the field via Zod's default unknown-key stripping. The matching API change landed in `buildinternet/releases#979`; once that ships in the published `releases-api-types` rev, the CLI's `--avatar` and `--no-avatar` flags affect the server state for real.

  Forward-compatible: existing scripts that already use `--avatar` start working without any CLI change — the wire shape didn't move, only the server-side acceptance did.

## 0.36.0

### Minor Changes

- d6c54fb: Improve the default `releases get` output for all entity kinds so the response is useful on its own without flag discovery, while staying token-efficient via progressive disclosure to the dedicated drill-in commands.
  - **Release**: the summary is now labeled `Summary · AI-generated, abbreviated` (it was unlabeled before, so callers couldn't tell it wasn't the full body). Every response ends with a `Next steps` footer that points at `releases release get <id>` for the full content — phrasing flips when no summary is on file yet.
  - **Organization**: now surfaces description, tags, a source breakdown (active / erroring / hidden), and the product list with names + slugs. Latest-releases preview trimmed from 10 to 5. Footer hints at `org get` (overview / accounts / aliases), `org overview`, and the org-scoped release feed.
  - **Product**: previously showed only static metadata. Now adds description, tags, and the product's source list, with footer hints to the org-scoped release feed and to drilling into a specific source.
  - **Source**: previously showed only static metadata. Now adds org/product binding, fetch status (active / erroring / hidden), `lastFetchedAt`, and the latest 5 releases for the source. Footer hints at `list --source`, `fetch-log`, and `release get`.

  Also fixes a latent bug in `getProductsByOrg`: `/v1/products` returns a paginated envelope but the client typed the response as a bare array, so every downstream `for/find/filter/map` was silently no-op'ing. That's why the previous `releases org get` Products section never rendered for orgs that had products (e.g. Supabase's Auth / CLI / Client SDK). The client now unwraps the envelope and tolerates the legacy bare-array shape.

  JSON output gains a few additive fields (`sources`, `products`, `sourceCount`, `tags`) on the org/product responses; existing fields are unchanged.

- 0fba348: Surface collections in `releases search` output. Direct LIKE matches on the collection's name/slug/description appear in a new "Collections" section, alongside member rollups for collections containing one of the matched orgs (with an `↳ includes …` hint). Use `--type collections` to narrow to that section. JSON output includes a new `collections` array on the response shell.

  Forward-compatible: the field is read as optional, so older API deployments mid-rollout still work — they just return `undefined` and the section stays empty until the API ships the matching change (`buildinternet/releases#955`).

### Patch Changes

- bf5e20d: Surface release body size on the latest-releases table (`releases get <org>`, `releases get <src_…>`, `releases tail`). Each row picks up a dim "~1.5K tokens" hint next to the title when the cached `contentTokens` field is available, so agents browsing a feed can decide whether to pull the full body before spending the round-trip. Compact mode only shows the hint for releases ≥1K tokens; `--with-summary` shows it on every row.

  Forward-compatible: the field is read as optional. API deployments mid-rollout return `undefined` and the hint is silently dropped. Lights up once `@buildinternet/releases-api-types` ships the matching wire-shape change (`buildinternet/releases#958`).

## 0.35.3

### Patch Changes

- 508fceb: Bump `@buildinternet/releases-core` to `^0.21.0` and `@buildinternet/releases-api-types` to `^0.16.0` so the bundled `CATEGORIES` constant picks up the `commerce`, `crm`, `finance`, and `productivity` slugs added in buildinternet/releases#889 and buildinternet/releases#891. Without this, `releases admin org update --category crm` (and the three other new slugs) rejects locally even though the API accepts them.

## 0.35.2

### Patch Changes

- f8f4654: Update the reader skill reference to mention the editable categories overlay (`PATCH /v1/categories/:slug`) and alias resolution behavior introduced in buildinternet/releases#889.

## 0.35.1

### Patch Changes

- 4998290: Drop deprecated `contentSummary`, `contentTitle`, and `contentTitleShort` aliases from all read paths. The CLI now reads only the canonical `summary`, `titleGenerated`, and `titleShort` fields introduced in buildinternet/releases#860. This is the consumer-side preflight gate for the alias removal tracked in buildinternet/releases#866.

## 0.35.0

### Minor Changes

- 14fa12d: Add `--title-generated`, `--title-short`, and `--summary` flags to `releases release update`. They write through to the API's PATCH /v1/sources/:slug/releases/:id endpoint, which exposes the renamed AI-generated release fields introduced in buildinternet/releases#860.

  Pass an empty string to clear a field (e.g. `releases release update rel_xxx --summary=""` writes NULL).

  The new fields are accepted by registries running api-types 0.13.0 or later; older registries silently ignore the unknown body keys.

## 0.34.0

### Minor Changes

- cb4c1bf: `admin overview update` accepts an optional `--citations-file <path>` pointing
  at a JSON array of inline citations (`{startIndex, endIndex, sourceUrl, title?,
citedText}[]`). The CLI validates the shape locally and forwards the array to
  `POST /v1/orgs/:slug/overview`, which persists them to `knowledge_page_citations`
  with replace-all semantics. Pairs with the regenerating-overviews skill, which
  now passes the file produced by the agent's response walk.

## 0.33.0

### Minor Changes

- 913fdd2: Collections are now first-class browsable from the CLI.
  - `releases collection list` and `releases collection get <slug>` are public — no API key needed. The same commands also stay under `admin` for back-compat.
  - New `releases collection releases <slug>` shows the cross-org release feed with cursor pagination (`--limit`, `--cursor`, `--include-prereleases`).
  - `releases get <orgslug>` now lists the collections an org belongs to. Failures degrade silently with a logger warning so an unrelated bug in the collections endpoint never breaks the canonical org card.

  The wire shape for `CollectionReleaseItem` isn't published in `@buildinternet/releases-api-types` yet, so the CLI declares it inline. When api-types ships its next minor, the inline type can drop.

- d2053e3: Tabular reader commands (`get`, `org list`, `product list`, `list sources`, `collection list`, `stats`, `check`, `fetch-log`, `admin overview list`, `admin overview plan`) now fit themselves to the terminal width instead of relying on bordered tables that broke when the window was narrow.
  - TTY: borderless, two-space delimited columns; uppercase cyan headers; per-column truncation with `…`; per-column right-alignment for counts. Width is read from `process.stdout.columns` (override with `COLUMNS=<n>`).
  - Non-TTY (piped): bare TSV — no headers, no color, no truncation — so `releases org list | cut -f2` works without parsing ANSI. For complete parseable output, prefer `--json`.

  Replaces `cli-table3` with a small in-tree renderer in `src/cli/render/table.ts` that uses `string-width` for accurate width measurement on ANSI-colored and wide-character cells. Per-column `noTruncate: true` locks a column to its natural width (e.g. release IDs, dates).

## 0.32.0

### Minor Changes

- 49873f1: Add `--category-allow <list>` and `--no-category-allow` flags to `releases admin source update` for setting per-source `metadata.categoryAllow` directly. Drops feed items whose `<category>` doesn't intersect the allowlist (case-insensitive); items with no category are dropped too. Useful on mixed-topic feeds where the upstream tags every entry — `openai.com/news/rss.xml` is the motivating case. Worker-side filter ships in buildinternet/releases#821.

  Also adds `scripts/bulk-suppress.ts`, an operator utility that reads `{id, reason}` NDJSON on stdin and runs `releases.suppress` with bounded concurrency (default 8). Used to clean up the existing noise on a source after enabling `categoryAllow`.

- 2cb93bb: Add `--changelog-paths` and `--no-changelog-paths` flags to `releases admin source update` for setting per-source `metadata.changelogPaths` overrides directly. Replaces the previous workflow of dropping to a raw `curl` against `/v1/sources/.../metadata`. Caps at 20 paths client-side to match the API worker's `CHANGELOG_MAX_FILES`.

## 0.31.0

### Minor Changes

- 052e167: Add `releases admin collection` command tree for managing curated cross-org collections (the playlists rendered at `/collections/<slug>` on the registry web app). Subcommands: `list`, `get <slug>`, `create <name>`, `update <slug>`, `delete <slug>`, plus `members add | set | remove` for membership management. Wraps the new admin write endpoints introduced in the registry API (#813); requires `@buildinternet/releases-api-types@^0.9.0`.

### Patch Changes

- 37b7bac: Drop the local `SessionDetail` shim in `task get` now that `@buildinternet/releases-api-types@0.8.1` exposes `agent`, `runner`, `correlationId`, `anthropicSessionId`, `usage`, `warnings`, and `result` natively on `Session`.

## 0.30.0

### Minor Changes

- a3e7980: Add `releases lookup domain <domain>` for resolving any URL-shaped input to its registry org/products, and `--domain <domain>` on `releases search` for scoping a search to a single org by domain. Mirrors the new `GET /v1/lookups/by-domain` API endpoint and `lookup_domain` MCP tool.
- 79cf3af: Add `releases admin discovery task get <session-id>` for full session detail (timing, usage, errors, agent state). Add `releases admin product adopt --merge-into <product>` to fold a source org into an existing product instead of creating a new one. Both close out items in buildinternet/releases#794.

## 0.29.0

### Minor Changes

- 41cb6d4: Extend `--dry-run` coverage to the remaining mutating `admin` commands.

  Previously only delete-shaped commands and a few specials (`source import`, `product adopt`, `release suppress`, `policy ignore/block`, `embed`) could preview their effects. Create/update/link verbs went straight to the API, which made scripted onboarding flows hard to validate before running them.

  Now also supports `--dry-run`:
  - `admin org create` (+ deprecated `org add`)
  - `admin org update` (+ deprecated `org edit`)
  - `admin org link`, `admin org unlink`
  - `admin product create` (+ deprecated `product add`)
  - `admin product update` (+ deprecated `product edit`)
  - `admin source create` (+ deprecated `source add`)
  - `admin source update` (+ deprecated `source edit`)
  - `admin release update` (+ deprecated `release edit`)
  - `admin release unsuppress`

  For `source create`, the dry-run still resolves the org (creating it would normally happen here, so the preview reports "would create" instead) and runs the existing-URL and exclusion checks before reporting the planned write — operators get the same rejection signal they would on a real run, without writes. Same idea for `source update`'s auto-create-org branch.

  Tag and alias add/remove on org/product still don't take `--dry-run`; those are trivially reversible joins where the preview adds little.

- f1f3fdb: Add `--into-org` / `--into-product` flags to `releases admin discovery onboard` and exit non-zero when `releases admin source create` finds a URL collision with mismatched org/product attribution. Both surfaced during the multi-product Google onboarding (#794).

  `--into-org <slug>` (and optionally `--into-product <slug>`) pin the discovery agent to attach every source it adds to that existing org/product, instead of the default behavior of letting the agent auto-create new ones. Eliminates the manual cleanup of orphan orgs that used to follow multi-product onboarding under an existing org. Server-side scope plumbing lands in the monorepo PR; the API surface is `intoOrgSlug` / `intoProductSlug` on `POST /v1/workflows/discover`.

  `source create` previously soft-warned and returned `existed: true` when the URL was already attached to a different org/product than the one passed via `--org` / `--product`. It now exits non-zero with the current attribution and a `releases admin source update` hint. `--strict` continues to reject any URL collision regardless of attribution.

### Patch Changes

- 9801893: Fix `releases admin overview inputs <org> --json` ignoring the flag and printing the chalk-formatted summary instead of JSON.

  Root cause was a commander parsing quirk: the deprecated bare `overview <org>` form is registered with `.argument("[org]")` on the same `overview` command that hosts subcommands like `inputs`, `get`, `update`. Without positional option scoping, options that follow a subcommand's positional arg (`overview inputs google --json`) were being swallowed before the subcommand could see them. The same bug affected `--check --json` and silently dropped any subcommand option that appeared after the org slug.

  Fixed by enabling `.enablePositionalOptions()` at the program level so each command's options are scoped to their own position. The deprecated `overview <org>` bare form still works.

## 0.28.1

### Patch Changes

- 1e617b8: Soften the not-found UX for read-only lookups (`releases get`, `releases release get`) and parallelize `releases get` fallback resolution.

  A miss on `releases get <thing>` is a normal answer for a lookup, not a software fault. The output now reads `[releases] No <kind> matching: <input>` (info-level, no red `ERROR:` framing). In `--json` mode the command also writes `null` to stdout before the stderr line, so JSON consumers get parseable output instead of nothing. Exit code stays `1` — the contract for "scripts can detect a miss" doesn't change.

  When the identifier doesn't carry a typed-ID prefix, `releases get` previously made up to three sequential API round-trips (`findOrg` → `findProduct` → `findSource`) before giving up. Those now run in parallel via `Promise.all`, so a miss takes ~one round-trip instead of three. Hits behave the same — the first matching kind wins.

  Mutating commands (`release delete/update/suppress/unsuppress`, `delete`, `update`, `ignore add/remove`, `product alias`, etc.) keep the louder error treatment; for those, "thing doesn't exist" really is an error.

## 0.28.0

### Minor Changes

- 724020c: Restructure `admin overview` as a subcommand group and add the planning manifest commands (closes [buildinternet/releases#715](https://github.com/buildinternet/releases/issues/715)).

  Canonical surface mirrors the verb-rename pattern (PR #113) — `admin overview list/get/update/inputs/plan` are subcommands under `admin overview`. The legacy kebab-case names (`overview-list`, `overview-write`, `overview-inputs`, and the bare `overview <slug>` read form) are wired as deprecated aliases that warn-and-delegate to the same handler.

  New planning surface:
  - `admin overview list --stale-days <n> --missing --has-activity --json` — drives `GET /v1/admin/overviews`, returning a planning-ready manifest in one call instead of `org list` + per-org `overview` round-trips. Each row includes `releasesSinceOverview` (the freshness signal that actually matters), `staleness` (`missing | behind | fresh`), `orgLastActivity`, etc. The legacy `--stale / --stale-min-releases / --stale-grace-days` flags still work and trigger the older client-side scan.
  - `admin overview plan --json` — same manifest with `format=plan`, adding per-row `action` (`missing | refresh | skip`) and `needsFetch` (true when active sources exist but ingest is lagging ≥ 7 days).
  - `admin overview inputs <org> --check` — pre-flight payload (`{orgSlug, selected, totalAvailable, hasExistingContent, wouldRegenerate, windowDays}`) so an orchestrator can decide whether to dispatch a regen sub-agent without paying for the full release-content + media payload.

  Requires `@buildinternet/releases-api-types` 0.6.0 on the server side.

### Patch Changes

- 7404ab5: Drop the local `EvaluationResult` and `OrgDependentsResponse` declarations from `src/api/types.ts` and pull both from `@buildinternet/releases-api-types` 0.7.0 instead. The carve-outs were only there because the canonical types lived in private monorepo packages; both have been upstreamed (`OrgDependentsResponse` since api-types 0.5.0, `EvaluationResult` in 0.7.0 — buildinternet/releases#569). No surface change for CLI consumers — the same shapes are now imported via `export * from "@buildinternet/releases-api-types"`.

## 0.27.0

### Minor Changes

- 0bc1f59: Accept typed IDs (`org_…`, `prod_…`, `src_…`, `rel_…`) anywhere a slug works.

  Help text and argument descriptions across `delete`, `fetch-log`, `tail`,
  `check`, `release`, `add`, `update`, `product`, `org`, `ignore`, `list`, and
  `fetch` now read "ID or slug" — no command rejects a typed ID anymore. The API
  accepted both shapes already; this aligns the CLI surface and docs with that
  contract. The `releases-cli` and `releases-mcp` skills are updated to recommend
  typed IDs in agent prompts where stability matters more than readability.

  Internally, `findOrg`, `removeOrg`, `getOrgDependents`, `updateOrg`,
  `getRecentReleases`, `getOverview`, `getPlaybook`, `getAliases`, and
  `setAliases` rename their `slug` parameter to `identifier` and gain
  `encodeURIComponent` wrappers (the path-building was previously unencoded —
  fine for current slug shapes but a lurking bug). `getFetchLogs({ sourceSlug })`
  becomes `getFetchLogs({ source })` and `getLatestReleases({ slug, orgSlug })`
  becomes `getLatestReleases({ source, org })` — both still accept whatever
  identifier shape the user types.

## 0.26.0

### Minor Changes

- 74297a5: Add `--notes-file` and `--parse-instructions-file` flags for AI-generated multi-paragraph content (#103 workstream 3). The inline `--notes` and `--parse-instructions` forms are quote-hostile and silently truncate at unescaped newlines, which is exactly the shape of content these flags get fed.
  - `releases admin playbook <org> --notes-file <path>` (use `-` for stdin) replaces inline notes.
  - `releases admin source update <id> --parse-instructions-file <path>` (use `-` for stdin) replaces inline parse instructions. The deprecated `edit` alias gets the same flag.
  - An empty file clears, matching the existing inline empty-string semantics.
  - Passing both forms together errors: `--notes and --notes-file are mutually exclusive` / `--parse-instructions and --parse-instructions-file are mutually exclusive`.

  The inline forms still work in this release but emit a stderr deprecation warning per invocation pointing at the file form. They will be removed in a future minor release.

  Skill manifests (`skills/managing-sources`, `skills/seeding-playbooks`) and bundled agent docs are updated to use the file form. While in there, the agent docs' stale `releases admin content playbook` path is corrected to the canonical `releases admin playbook`.

### Patch Changes

- 57e8a68: Apply `--tags` on idempotent `org create` retry (#116). When `releases admin org create acme --tags react` is followed by `releases admin org create acme --tags typescript`, the second call now adds `typescript` to the existing org instead of silently dropping the flag. Tag merging is additive (no removal), and `--strict` continues to bail on duplicate detection before reconciliation runs.

## 0.25.0

### Minor Changes

- b2938c0: Add `releases agent-context` command that emits a versioned JSON document describing every command, argument, option, and exit code in the CLI.

  This is the L2 introspection layer described in the [10-principle agent-native CLI guide](https://trevinsays.com/p/10-principles-for-agent-native-clis): agents driving the CLI can answer questions like "does this flag accept stdin?" or "what commands are deprecated?" without spawning `--help` per command and parsing prose.

  The schema is generated at runtime by walking Commander's program tree — it stays automatically in sync with the implementation. `schemaVersion` is a string that bumps only on breaking field renames or removals; additive changes (new commands, new options, new fields) are silent.

- b94319a: Make `org create` and `source create` idempotent on retry. When a duplicate slug (org) or duplicate URL (source) is detected, the existing record is returned instead of erroring — exit code 0, JSON output gains an `existed: true` field. Pass `--strict` to restore the previous exit-1 behavior for callers that require hard failure on conflict.
- 3971251: Add `--limit <n>` / `--page <n>` pagination to four list commands and consume the
  `{ items, pagination }` envelope the API now returns for `/v1/orgs`,
  `/v1/admin/blocklist`, `/v1/orgs/:slug/ignored-urls`, and `/v1/sessions`
  (monorepo PR #723):
  - `releases org list`
  - `releases admin discovery task list`
  - `releases admin policy block list`
  - `releases admin policy ignore list`

  All four pass `?limit=&page=` through to the API and read the server's
  pagination metadata directly — no more client-side `Array.slice()`. Each prints
  a `warning: results may be truncated` message to stderr when more pages are
  available and no explicit `--limit` was supplied, mirroring `releases list`.
  Closes #105.

- a27f459: Adopt the `-` stdin convention in two more commands and tighten `--json` output safety on alias listings.
  - `releases import <file>` now accepts `-` for stdin (`cat manifest.json | releases import -`). Removes the temp-file dance for callers that generate manifests from another command.
  - `releases admin webhook verify --body-file <path>` now accepts `-` for stdin (`curl ... | releases admin webhook verify --secret ... --signature ... --body-file -`). Mirrors the convention already in `add --batch -` and `admin overview-write --content-file -`.
  - `org alias list --json` and `product alias list --json` now route through the drain-safe `writeJson()` helper instead of `console.log(JSON.stringify(...))`. Closes the small remaining surface area of the 96 KB pipe-truncation class first fixed in #33.

  Shared internal helper `readContentArg(pathOrDash)` lives in `src/lib/input.ts` for use by future file-or-stdin commands. No breaking changes — existing `--content-file <path>` / positional `<file>` invocations continue to work unchanged.

- 1821835: Rename CRUD verbs to standard create/get/update/delete equivalents. The old verb names (add, show, edit, remove) are retained as deprecated aliases that continue to work but print a deprecation warning to stderr. This affects top-level commands and all `org`, `product`, `source`, and `release` subcommands.

### Patch Changes

- f9eb1e2: Documents the exit-code taxonomy in README and root help output.

## 0.24.0

### Minor Changes

- 0c244f3: Adopt the org-scoped API path shape so the CLI keeps working after the monorepo rejects bare-slug source/product paths with 400 (#698).
  - `findSource(identifier)` and `findProduct(identifier)` now branch on the input shape: typed `src_…`/`prod_…` IDs hit the legacy bare path (still safe — IDs are globally unique), `org/slug` coordinates split into the org-scoped form, and bare slugs round-trip through the new `GET /v1/lookups/{source,product}-by-slug` resolver to pick a canonical home before fetching.
  - Mutation helpers (`updateSource`, `deleteSource`, `deleteSources`, `deleteReleasesForSource`, `insertReleasesBatch`, `checkContentHash`, `updateSourceMeta`, `updateProduct`) now take a typed-ID-bearing entity object instead of a slug string and target the bare path with `id`, which the API still accepts.
  - `getKnownReleasesForSource(identifier, …)` accepts the same identifier shapes as `findSource`.

  No CLI command surface changes — operators continue to type slugs, IDs, or `org/slug` coordinates wherever an identifier is accepted. The slug branch costs one extra round-trip to the lookup endpoint per command (cached aggressively at the network layer), which is the price for unambiguous resolution after #690 made slugs per-org.

- 2a775fb: `admin org delete --hard` now shows a cascade-scope preview and requires the user to type the org slug back to confirm. Backs the post-#690 Phase C schema, where hard-deleting an org now cascades into every source, release, fetch_log, changelog file/chunk, release summary, media asset, and webhook subscription tied to it (vs. orphaning sources via SET NULL pre-flip).
  - `releases admin org delete <slug> --hard` lists exact dependent counts, then waits for slug typeback. Wrong slug aborts with exit 1 and no API call to the destructive endpoint.
  - `--yes` / `-y` skips the prompt for scripted ops.
  - A piped (non-TTY) stdin without `--yes` exits 1 with a clear "no interactive TTY" message instead of silently auto-confirming.
  - Soft-delete (default, no `--hard`) is unchanged — still tombstones via `deleted_at`, no prompt.
  - `admin org remove` continues to work as an alias of `admin org delete`.

  Counts are pulled from the new `GET /v1/admin/orgs/:slug/dependents` endpoint, so the preview matches whatever the API would actually cascade-delete. Requires `@buildinternet/releases-api-types` ≥ 0.5.0 on the server side.

### Patch Changes

- 57cad43: Bump `@buildinternet/releases-api-types` to `^0.4.0`. Adds the optional `type: "feature" | "rollup"` field to release-shaped wire types (`ReleaseItem`, `ReleaseDetail`, `SearchReleaseHit`) so consumers can render rollup posts (Brex Fall Release, Ramp quarterly editions, etc.) differently from feature releases. Optional on the wire — older API responses degrade gracefully.

## 0.23.0

### Minor Changes

- c80aacb: feat(cli): publish a Windows x64 binary. `npm install -g @buildinternet/releases` now works on Windows; the dispatcher resolves `releases.exe` from the new `@buildinternet/releases-windows-x64` platform package. Homebrew remains macOS/Linux-only. `windows-arm64` is intentionally not shipped — open an issue if you need it.

## 0.22.1

### Patch Changes

- d61db7e: fix(cli): show full release IDs in `search`, `tail`, and the releases table. The previous 12-char prefix wasn't usable for any follow-up call (the API only resolves full IDs, not short forms), so the truncation was misleading without saving real horizontal space.

## 0.22.0

### Minor Changes

- 1901903: `webhook verify` now enforces a ±5 minute timestamp window by default to prevent replay-attack acceptance. Pass `--allow-stale` to skip the window check when verifying old captured payloads.

## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- de74c5f: Add on-demand lookup rendering to `releases search`. When the API returns a `lookup` payload (coordinate-shaped queries like `org/repo` that miss every curated entity), a new **Lookup** section prints before the regular results — covering all five outcomes (`indexed`, `existing`, `empty`, `not_found`, `deferred`) plus an inline release preview (up to 5) and a "Did you mean" rail when the org segment matches a curated org. The payload is also included in `--json` output. Bumps the `@buildinternet/releases-api-types` pin to `^0.3.0`.

## 0.20.2

### Patch Changes

- 4178044: Adopt the `catalog` rename in unified search responses (monorepo issue #539 follow-up). `releases search` now reads `response.catalog` and renders the section as **Catalog** in human and markdown output (it covered products + standalone sources already; the header now matches the wire field). `--type catalog` is the canonical filter; `--type products` is accepted as a deprecated alias. The deprecated `response.products` field is still read as a fallback so older API deploys keep working — that fallback can be dropped once the alias is removed from the wire. Plugin docs and the `releases-mcp` skill updated to point at the new `search` / `list_catalog` / `get_catalog_entry` MCP tools.
- ac4a443: Disable oxlint's `no-underscore-dangle` rule, surfaced by the 1.62 upgrade. The codebase deliberately uses leading-underscore identifiers for module-private state (`_dataDir`, `_apiUrl`, `_apiKey`, `_admin`); the rule's complaints aren't actionable. Keeps lint output clean and matches the same change in the monorepo for cross-repo consistency. CI-only; no runtime change.

## 0.20.1

### Patch Changes

- 24316b1: Move admin blocklist calls to `/v1/admin/blocklist` (was `/v1/blocked-urls`). The registry renamed the route to align with the `/v1/admin/...` convention; the old path is going away. Affects `releases admin block` / `unblock` and the `releases whoami` admin probe.

  Closes [registry #524](https://github.com/buildinternet/releases/issues/524).

- c0935e7: Add the `bun` ecosystem to the Dependabot config so npm dependency bumps land as weekly grouped PRs (production and dev separated). Pairs with the SHA-pinned GitHub Actions config — bun.lock already pins every package by sha512 integrity hash and CI runs with `--frozen-lockfile`, so this closes the loop on surfacing upstream drift. CI-only; no runtime behavior change.

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- cb55e62: `releases admin source fetch` now accepts `--wait [seconds]`, blocking until the managed-agent session reaches a terminal state. Without `--wait` the command stays fire-and-forget. Default wait is 900s; pass an explicit value to shorten it (e.g. `--wait 60`).

  Exit codes:
  - `0` — session completed successfully
  - `1` — our-side error (no tools called, parser failure, timeout)
  - `2` — managed-agents/provider error (e.g. `unknown_error`, `model_overloaded_error`, retries exhausted) — the message is tagged `(managed-agents · <type>)` and includes retry count when the session ended in `retries_exhausted`
  - `130` — session cancelled

  Closes the silent-failure gap surfaced in [registry #590](https://github.com/buildinternet/releases/issues/590) where backend incidents bubbled up as `exit 0` even though no work happened.

- f0eab05: `releases admin overview-list` lists organizations with their overview status. Pass `--stale` to filter to orgs whose overviews need regeneration:

  ```
  releases admin overview-list --stale
  releases admin overview-list --stale --stale-min-releases 3 --stale-grace-days 14
  releases admin overview-list --stale --json
  ```

  An org is considered stale when `recentReleaseCount > minReleases` AND the overview is either missing or `lastActivity > overview.updatedAt + graceDays`. Defaults: `minReleases=5`, `graceDays=7`.

  The `--json` output carries `slug`, `name`, `recentReleaseCount`, `lastActivity`, `overviewUpdatedAt`, and `overviewMissing` — suitable for piping into the weekly regen routine (registry trigger `trig_012B14fpLS1inAkEuJTZBbnd`) which currently encodes this filter in its prompt.

  Closes [registry #590](https://github.com/buildinternet/releases/issues/590) item 6.

### Patch Changes

- ec6a649: Bump `@buildinternet/releases-api-types` to `^0.2.0`. The classification fields (`errorSource`, `errorType`, `stopReason`, `retryCount`) added by the registry to the `Session` shape now come straight from the published types, so the CLI's local `SessionWithClassification` extension is gone. No behavior change.
- 41b7a95: `releases admin overview-write` now accepts `--unescape-html`, which runs a small pre-upload pass to decode `&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, and `&#39;`. Useful when the markdown was generated by a sub-agent that escaped entities reflexively.

## 0.19.5

### Patch Changes

- 487ea5b: Replace the handwritten `src/api/types.ts` with a re-export from the newly-published `@buildinternet/releases-api-types` package. Eliminates drift between the CLI's wire-protocol types and the monorepo source.

  Additive fields now surfaced on `--json` output:
  - Source shapes gain `lastPolledAt`, `medianGapDays`, `lastRetieredAt`
  - New `ReleaseCoverageResponse` / `ReleaseCoverageRow` types for release coverage consumers
  - `SearchCatalogHit` is now the canonical name for catalog/product search hits (`SearchProductHit` remains as a deprecated alias)

## 0.19.4

### Patch Changes

- 31c2a64: Admin log routes moved under `/v1/admin/logs/*` on the API per issue #504 tier 3. The `releases admin source fetch-log` command and `getUsageStats` / `postUsageLog` / `postFetchLog` helpers are unchanged from the user's perspective, only the underlying URLs shift:
  - `GET /v1/fetch-log` → `GET /v1/admin/logs/fetch`
  - `POST /v1/fetch-log` → `POST /v1/admin/logs/fetch`
  - `GET /v1/usage-log/stats` → `GET /v1/admin/logs/usage/stats`
  - `POST /v1/usage-log` → `POST /v1/admin/logs/usage`

## 0.19.3

### Patch Changes

- 4f9ed94: Discovery triggers moved under `/v1/workflows/*` on the API per issue #504 tier 2. The `releases admin discovery onboard` and `releases admin fetch` commands are unchanged from the user's perspective, but the underlying URLs now follow the convention:
  - `POST /v1/discover` → `POST /v1/workflows/discover`
  - `POST /v1/update` → `POST /v1/workflows/update`
  - `GET /v1/discover/:sessionId` is gone — the CLI polls `GET /v1/sessions/:sessionId` instead, which reads from the same DO with a richer shape (progress fields live at the top level, not nested under `progress`).

- 1ef271f: Follow-up to the overview nesting: three more API surfaces moved under their parent resource.
  - Playbook: `getPlaybook(slug)` and `updatePlaybookNotes(slug, notes)` now call `/v1/orgs/:slug/playbook` and `/v1/orgs/:slug/playbook/notes`.
  - Summaries: `getSummariesForSource`, `upsertSummary`, and `getMonthlySummary` now call `/v1/sources/:slug/summaries`. `upsertSummary`'s signature changed from `(data)` (with `sourceId` in the body) to `(sourceSlugOrId, data)`.
  - Aliases: the `/v1/aliases` endpoints are gone. Domain aliases are now a `string[]` field on the parent — read via `/v1/orgs/:slug` or `/v1/products/:slug`, written via `PATCH { aliases: [...] }` on the parent. The CLI replaces `addDomainAlias`/`removeDomainAlias`/`listDomainAliases` with `getAliases(scope, slug)` and `setAliases(scope, slug, aliases)`. `releases org alias add|remove|list` and `releases product alias add|remove|list` commands are unchanged from the user's perspective.

  `/v1/knowledge` is also gone from the API. No CLI helper referenced it.

- 049528f: Overview admin commands now call the nested API routes (`/v1/orgs/:slug/overview`, `/v1/orgs/:slug/overview/inputs`, `/v1/products/:slug/overview`). The `releases admin overview-read`, `overview-write`, and `overview-inputs` commands are unchanged — only the URLs the CLI hits have moved.

  `OverviewInputs.selected` entries now carry pre-hydrated `content` (absolute CDN URLs) and a typed `media` array with `r2Url` resolved, so the overview agent can paste image URLs directly into generated markdown.

## 0.19.2

### Patch Changes

- fae0396: Send a distinctive `User-Agent` header (`releases-cli/<version> (+https://releases.sh)`) on every outbound HTTP request — registry API calls, `releases check` feed probes, update checks, telemetry. Replaces the previous fall-through to Bun/undici's default `node` UA so api.releases.sh analytics and third-party site operators can identify CLI traffic.

## 0.19.1

### Patch Changes

- caf3cdc: **Fix `releases admin embed {releases,entities,changelogs}` after monorepo route consolidation**

  The API worker moved the three embed-backfill triggers from `/v1/admin/embed/*` to `/v1/workflows/embed-*` in [buildinternet/releases#494](https://github.com/buildinternet/releases/issues/494). Without this bump, those three commands return `404` against the live API.

  Changes:
  - `embedReleases` now posts to `/v1/workflows/embed-releases`
  - `embedEntities` now posts to `/v1/workflows/embed-entities`
  - `embedChangelogs` now posts to `/v1/workflows/embed-changelogs`
  - `getEmbedStatus` stays on `/v1/admin/embed/status` (telemetry reads were not moved)

  The `releases admin embed …` command surface is unchanged — the path rename is invisible to users.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- e04effe: **Skills synced to the monorepo's consolidated tool surface**

  Mirrors the tool-UX consolidation from the monorepo (upstream issue [buildinternet/releases#459](https://github.com/buildinternet/releases/issues/459)). Deprecated per-action tool names are replaced with the consolidated equivalents across every skill that cited them.

  Typed-tool renames:
  - `add_source` / `edit_source` / `remove_source` / `fetch_source` → `manage_source` with `action: "add" | "edit" | "remove" | "fetch"`
  - `get_playbook` / `update_playbook_notes` → `manage_playbook` with `action: "get" | "update_notes"`
  - `list_categories` — retired; valid categories surface via `manage_org` / `manage_product` tool descriptions and system prompts

  Skill-specific changes:
  - `managing-sources` — Primary Sources section rewritten with conditional `is_primary` guidance, added a note about the slug auto-suffix behavior on `manage_source(action=add)`, ported the Organization Descriptions + Embedding Side Effects sections from upstream.
  - `seeding-playbooks` and `parsing-changelogs` — replaced the stale `releases admin content playbook` CLI path with `releases admin playbook` (the `content` subgroup was removed in #42).
  - `analyzing-releases` and `finding-changelogs` — call-site updates only.

  No CLI behavior changes.

## 0.18.0

### Minor Changes

- 254599f: feat(admin): add `overview`, `overview-inputs`, `overview-write` commands

  Restores the operator-side surface for AI overview regeneration after
  `@buildinternet/releases` deleted the local generator in #385. Pairs with the
  new server route `GET /v1/overview-inputs` and the existing dumb upsert at
  `POST /v1/overview`. Generation itself runs in Claude Code via the
  `regenerating-overviews` skill — no Anthropic client returns to the CLI.
  - `releases admin overview <slug>` — read the current overview
  - `releases admin overview-inputs <slug> --json [--window N]` — input-builder
  - `releases admin overview-write <slug> --content-file <path>` — upload result

## 0.17.0

### Minor Changes

- eaeb755: **`releases admin discovery evaluate <url>` is back**

  Ships the missing thin wrapper around `GET /v1/evaluate?url=...`, returning the AI-backed ingestion recommendation (method, feed URL, provider, confidence, alternatives). Supports `--json` for piping into `jq`. Mirrors the typed MCP `evaluate_url` tool.

  The legacy top-level alias `releases evaluate <url>` still resolves to this subcommand (with a deprecation warning).

  The stale `discover` entry in the legacy alias table has been removed — it pointed to a subcommand that never existed, and the API's `POST /v1/discover` is already covered by `releases admin discovery onboard`. The one in-repo docs reference has been updated.

- 51ec406: **`releases admin playbook <org>` is back**

  Ships the missing CLI wrapper for reading and updating an organization's playbook. Same shape as the old monorepo command, flattened from `admin content playbook` to `admin playbook` (no other live inhabitants of the `admin content` subgroup remain).
  - `releases admin playbook <org>` — read the assembled playbook (header + agent notes)
  - `releases admin playbook <org> --json` — JSON output
  - `releases admin playbook <org> --notes "..."` — replace agent notes; seeds a fresh header on first write

  The old `--regenerate` flag is not being ported. It called deterministic logic (no AI) that already runs automatically via `waitUntil` after every source add/edit/remove, and the `--notes` PATCH route auto-seeds a fresh header if no playbook exists yet.

  Closes buildinternet/releases#246.

## 0.16.1

### Patch Changes

- 8c3a579: Fix `--json` output being truncated at ~96 KB when piped to another process. All JSON output now awaits stdout `drain` before the CLI exits, so piping `releases admin source list --json | jq ...` works correctly on large datasets.

## 0.16.0

### Minor Changes

- 7e617c7: **CLI JSON contract: shared envelope, parsed metadata, truncation warnings**

  `releases list --json` now returns a consistent `{ items, pagination }` envelope whether or not `--limit` is passed, parses `metadata` into a nested object (no more `.metadata | fromjson?` in jq), and emits a stderr warning when results may be truncated.
  - **New shared types** in `@buildinternet/releases-core/cli-contracts`: `ListResponse<T>`, `Pagination`, `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`, `computePagination()`, `parseMetadataField()`, `formatTruncationWarning()`. Single source of truth for the CLI's `--json` output shape.
  - **Default page size is now 500** (previously 100, the API's silent default) so a default `releases list --json` call returns 5× more rows before any risk of truncation. Explicit `--limit` still wins.
  - **Metadata fields are parsed** into nested objects in `--json` output for both the list view and single-source detail view.
  - **Stderr truncation warning** when no `--limit` was passed and `hasMore` is true — no more silent loss of rows.
  - **`--flat` flag** returns the legacy bare-array shape for scripts still tied to it. Not recommended; use the envelope.
  - **Server-side pagination** — `--limit` and `--page` are now passed through to the API instead of applied client-side to an already-truncated result set.

  Fixes buildinternet/releases-cli#24 (CLI side). An API-side follow-up will add an opt-in envelope response so `totalItems` can be populated for every page; until then `totalItems` is only set when the tail of the list is reached.

- 94e05dc: **Add `releases whoami` — mode, API URL, and auth diagnostic**

  New top-level command that reports how the CLI is configured:
  - Current CLI version
  - API URL and whether it's the default (`https://api.releases.sh`) or overridden via `RELEASED_API_URL`
  - Mode (`public` vs `admin`) based on whether `RELEASED_API_KEY` is set
  - Redacted API key hint (first 4 + last 4 characters) so users can confirm which key is active without leaking it
  - Optional `--check` flag that probes the API — a public read in public mode, an auth-gated read in admin mode, so an invalid key surfaces as a 401 instead of a silent success
  - `--json` flag for machine-readable output

### Patch Changes

- 2da36c8: **`releases list --json` now surfaces accurate `totalItems` on every page**

  The API's `?envelope=true` response is now consumed end-to-end: `totalItems`, `totalPages`, and `hasMore` are populated on the first page as well as the tail, instead of only when the final page is reached. The stderr truncation warning on the table view now uses the API-returned `hasMore` instead of inferring from `returned === pageSize` (which flagged spuriously when totalItems was an exact multiple of pageSize).
  - `listSourcesWithOrg({ envelope: true })` returns `ListResponse<SourceWithOrg>` via a typed overload; existing bare-array callers (`check`, MCP) are untouched.
  - Closes the loop opened by the API's envelope support (buildinternet/releases#356).

## 0.15.0

### Minor Changes

- 08b7297: Add `releases tail` as the canonical "latest releases" command (with `latest` retained as an alias), plus `-f/--follow` streaming mode:
  - `releases tail -f` polls the cached `/v1/releases/latest` endpoint on a 60-second interval (configurable with `--interval <seconds>`) and streams new releases as they arrive. Novelty detection is client-side via a bounded seen-id set, so every follow-poller collapses onto the shared KV cache entry rather than forking it with a per-client `since`.
  - `getLatestReleases` now calls the unified `/v1/releases/latest` endpoint in a single request. Replaces the previous scatter-gather (fetch `/sources`, call `/sources/:slug` for the first 10, sort locally), which sampled rather than enumerated and meant the CLI's "latest across all sources" was incomplete for indexes larger than 10 sources.
  - Extracted `renderLatestReleasesTable` into `src/cli/render/` so `tail` and `show` share one formatter.

  Requires the API worker to expose `GET /v1/releases/latest` (shipped in the monorepo alongside this change).

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 972ff89: Surface AI-generated org overviews more readily in the CLI:
  - `releases org show <slug>` now prints a short preview (first ~80 words) of the AI overview with a generated-at hint and a "⚠ older than 30 days" stale warning where appropriate.
  - New `releases org overview <slug>` command (public read, no auth) prints the full overview body with the same staleness signal.
  - `@buildinternet/releases-core/overview` exports shared helpers — `OVERVIEW_STALE_DAYS`, `overviewAgeDays`, `isOverviewStale`, `overviewPreview` — used by both the CLI and the upstream MCP server.

### Patch Changes

- f864aea: Include README in the published npm tarball so the package page on npmjs.com renders install + usage docs. A `prepack` script copies the repo-root README into the package directory at publish time.

## 0.13.2

### Patch Changes

- 3d4df61: Pin CI to bun canary to pick up oven-sh/bun#29272 — fixes `bun build --compile` producing Mach-O binaries that Apple Silicon SIGKILLs on exec due to a broken LC_CODE_SIGNATURE size in bun 1.3.12. Also leapfrogs the npm version timeline past the orphaned `@buildinternet/releases@0.13.0` left behind during the monorepo → OSS repo extraction.

## 0.12.1

### Patch Changes

- ef08acb: Bootstrap public tap distribution — first release cut from the extracted OSS repo. Publishes binaries to `buildinternet/releases-cli` GitHub Releases and regenerates the Homebrew formula at `buildinternet/homebrew-tap`.
